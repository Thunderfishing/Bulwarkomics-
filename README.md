# Bulwarkomics

## Introduction

Bulwarkomics is an economic modeling project designed to explore the integration of co-operative collectivism and capitalism, developed as a university economics assignment with xAI Grok 3 assistance. This repository constructs New Crossroadsâ€”a speculative, debt-free economy launched with a 2025 debt reset ($13 trillion), scaling to a $38.94 trillion GDP by 2075 (65% co-ops, $25.31 trillion). Through legislative acts and a simulation, it examines a system of 18 million debt-free students, 25 million service graduates supporting 13 million journeymen, and a defense framework with 9.1 million militia and a $920 billion fund, backed by a $3.082 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund and a $407 billion Bulwark Coin reserve. Bulwarkomics tests how collective ownership aligns with market efficiency, embodying an ethos of worker-driven resilience in a capitalist structure.
